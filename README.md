> The future of art sales.

<br>

## Motivation

Humans are creative creatures. We use our brains to dream up fantastical and impossible things. Artists bring these things to life. This looks like paintings, music, writing, and more. Many of our favorite stories and memories are because of art. We love these things so much we're willing to pay for them, sometimes at tremendous valuations.

The problem is, when art gets resold at higher and higher multiples the artists don't get a piece of those profits. As a result, the phrase "starving artist" is a stereotype that is often associated with creatives. It's very hard to make any money creating art! It doesn't have to be this way. For example, look at startups. Founders have an idea, then create a product, and then sell ownership in that thing. As the value of an app or company grows, the value of the founder's shares grow too. Imagine if tech startup founders just sold 100% of their companies at the earliest stage. Investors would get all the value out of future funding rounds and developers would be broke!

With LexArt artist can create content, then tokenize it, and that token contract will enforce revenue sharing of secondary sales with the artist. Now artists can get the full value of their art vs just the first price someone is willing to buy it at. LexArt puts the power back in the hands of the artists.
